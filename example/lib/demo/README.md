# Demo

This directory contains a command line example demonstrating a complete
workflow with `xtream_code_client`.

Edit `demo.dart` and provide your server URL, port, username and password,
then run:

```bash
dart run demo/demo.dart
```

The script prints category counts, retrieves items and details, and demonstrates
how to build playback URLs for streams, movies and series episodes. It also
loads the full EPG as well as channel-specific EPG data for a stream.
